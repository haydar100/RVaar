- Notification Getting Location is bugged when GPS is turned off (renders it above the popup)
- MarineTraffic API needs to be implemented so we can add nearby boats as markers
- location.getSpeed() returns speed only when GPS is available (we can add also calculate it by measuring the distanceBetween and then dividing)
